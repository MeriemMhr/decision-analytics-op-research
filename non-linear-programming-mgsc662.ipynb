Late submissions are NOT accepted. Also, files not in the correct format (other than a Jupyter Notebook) are NOT accepted.\n",
    "2. You can submit your answer file multiple times, but only the last submission is kept and graded.\n",
    "3. For each question, print all the results that the question asks. Also, prevent printing unnecessary information.\n",

    "# Problem 1: The Markowitz Problem (50 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Story:\n",
    "\n",
    "A rational investor wishes for a low variance on return and a high expected rate of return. However, the two goals seldom align. For example, you can always keep variance down by investing in bonds over stocks, but you do so at the expense of a decent rate of return. So, an investor's optimal portfolio could be described by ($r, \\sigma$), where $r$ is a desired (and feasible) average rate of return, and $\\sigma$ is the minimal standard deviation possible for this given $r$. (Put differently, an investor might wish to find the highest rate of return possible for a given acceptable level of risk.) This problem is due originally to Harry Markowitz in the 1950's.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Data:\n",
    "\n",
    "The data in the Excel file \"Markowitz\" provides the performances of five stock exchange indices from 31 Dec 2010 to 1 June 2016. Throughout this problem, we will use that dataset to find the optimal portfolio. But before that, we go through some warm-up questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Caution:\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem, do not convert the values to percentages. Using percentages can lead to wrong results if you're not cautious."

The convexity stems from the objective function, minimizing variance, which is inherently convex in portfolio weights due to the positive semi-definite nature of the covariance matrix. Linear constraints (sum of weights equals 1, non-negative weights) further maintain the convexity. When faced with non-convex constraints, setting model.params.NonConvex to 2 is necessary for problem resolution."

    "John Brooks, managing director of the CYCOM Corporation, is trying to determine how to allocate CYCOM's research and development budget for the coming year. Six different projects are under consideration. John believes that the success of every project depends in part on the number of engineers assigned to the project. Let $x_1, ..., x_6$ denote the number of engineers assigned to projects 1,...,6. According to internal corporate estimates, the probability that each project will be successful is given according to the function in the third column of Table 1:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if 10 engineers are assigned to project 1, the probability of success in that project is $\\frac{10}{10 + 1.1} = 0.901$. Cycom can assign up to 25 engineers to these six projects. The cost of an engineer is $\\$150,000$ (per year). An engineer can be assigned to more than one project. For example, $x_2$ = 3.4 means that 3.4 engineers are assigned to Project 2, which means that 3 engineers are assigned to this project full-time, and one engineer is assigned to this project only 40% of the time. Nonetheless, the total number of hired engineers should be an integer less than or equal to 25.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a project is unsuccessful, it incurs its full start-up cost, shown in the second column of Table 1. If the project is successful, it realizes the profit value shown in the fourth column of Table 1. This value includes the start-up cost of the project (but does not include the cost of engineers). Thus, for example, if Project 1 is unsuccessful, it incurs a cost of $\\$325,000$. If Project 1 is successful, it will realize a profit of $\\$1,750,000$.\n",

The expected profit of each project is the probability of its success times the profit if successful minus the probability of its failure multiplied by the start-up cost. For instance, suppose the probability of success for Project 1 is $P_1$. Then, the expected profit for Project 1 is $P_1 \\times 1,750,000 - (1 - P_1) \\times 325,000$. "

    "Similar to the stock market problem, we can also use the uncertainty approach to solve this problem. In this approach, we want to minimize the uncertainty (the standard deviation) in the total profit of CYCOM. For this, suppose the success or failure of each project is independent of the success or failure of other projects. Then, the variance of the total expected profit of CYCOM is the sum of the variances of the expected profits of each project. Although we want to decrease the uncertainty in the total profit of CYCOM, we want the expected profit of CYCOM to be at least $1.1 million.\n",
