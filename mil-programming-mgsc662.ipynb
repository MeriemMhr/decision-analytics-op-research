    "1. Answer the questions in this Jupyter Notebook file and upload it in the Assignment 2 entry under the Assignments tab in MyCourses. Answer each question in its own place. Late submissions are NOT accepted. Also, files not in the correct format (other than a Jupyter Notebook) are NOT accepted.\n",
    "2. You can submit your answer file multiple times, but only the last submission is kept and graded.\n",
    "3. For each question, make sure to print all the results that the question asks. Also, prevent printing unnecessary information.\n",
    "4. We only grade the final answer, not the code, for coding questions. However, as the coding part of Question 7 can be a bit challenging, we will give **partial credit** for **concise and correct** explanations provided instead of the code only for this question. (Simple criterion: Your explanations should shed light on things that are not obvious from the question itself!) \n",
    "5. Simple explanations are not enough for formulation questions, and you have to write the exact mathematical formulation of the problem. If you are using an additional variable, introduce it clearly."

    "# Problem 1: The Apportionment Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Story:\n",
    "The problem of allocating parliamentary seats in a *fair* way is a political matter in democratic societies. Suppose a country with a total population of $N = \\sum_i p_i$ tries to allocate its $s$ available seats to its provinces, each with a population of $p_i$. The *common sense* says that the *fair* way to distribute these seats is to allocate each province a seat quota proportional to its population:\n",
    "$$q_i = s \\times \\frac{p_i}{\\sum_i p_i}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Although this solution seems appealing, it ignores that the number of allocated seats must be **integers**. For instance, in a country with 30 million population and 130 parliament seats, the seat quota for a province with a population of 5 million is $q_i = \\frac{5 \\times 130}{30} = 21.\\overline{66}$, which is impossible. In this problem, we will use two methods that you are familiar with to address this issue - plus some additional considerations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Data:\n",
    "The country we are working on has 20 provinces, and its parliament has 601 seats. In the attached file *assignment2_data.csv*, you can find the dataset for this problem. The first column is the province's name, the second column is the province's population, and the third column is the quota ($q_i$) for the province. The quota for each province is the continuous value we calculated using the formula above as $q_i = s \\times \\frac{p_i}{\\sum_i p_i}$. Read the dataset using Python's Pandas package - or any package you choose - and extract the relevant information. (To ensure everyone is working with the same data, do not calculate the quotas again yourself; just use the given $q_i$ s.) For example, in this dataset, the population of province $P4$ is 3200000, and the quota for this province is 13.16359."

(Notice that the mall can have more than one unit of each kind of store/facility as long as you do not pass the maximum number limit.)\n",

    "\n",
    "We have been through the problems BalancedMilk faces after it lost its largest supplier multiple times. (You may review Assignment and Quiz 1 if you forgot them.) The issue is not resolved yet, and $S_8$ is still shut down. BalancedMilk managers are so excited that now you know how to implement logical constraints using MIP, because they want you to help them with their new problem! They gave you the following information:\n",
    "1. BalancedMilk is **not** committed to distributing the milk supplied by the remaining supply centers, $S_1$ to $S_7$. (It has the option not to distribute the milk it receives from the remaining supply centers.) Additionally, it **must not** oversupply any demand market.\n",
    "2. The cost of not supplying (not delivering) milk to each demand market is 15$/tonne.\n",
    "3. $S_3$, $S_4$, and $S_5$ belong to the same company. The company has imposed the following constraint: BalancedMilk should utilize $\\geq50\\%$ (equal or more than $50\\%$) of the capacity of at least two of the three supply centers owned by this company.\n",
    "4. Because $D_5$ and $D_6$ are close, the firm has some flexibility in answering their demands. So either $D_5$ receives $\\geq80\\%$ of its demand, or $D_6$ receives $\\geq60\\%$ of its demand, or both.\n",
    "5. A competitor is trying to damage BalancedMilk's reputation by focusing on the discrimination it imposes between different demand centers. This competitor is trying to exploit the difference between $D_2$ and $D_8$ and $D_9$. Therefore, to respond to this criticism, if $D_2$ receives $> 50\\%$ of its demand, then $D_8$ and $D_9$ should both receive $\\geq50\\%$ of their demand as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Trust me. I am not a recruiter for any dairy transportation company, and neither am I preparing the MMA cohort for an internship at one. It is just that BalancedMilk has so many unresolved issues!)"
